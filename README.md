Principles of Robot Autonomy

## Still To Do:
1. Add homework material to appropriate chapters.
2. Add section material somehow?
3. Add remaining chapters for AA274B: modern computer vision, imitation learning, robot manipulation, human-robot interaction? (also still have placeholder for autoware in AA274A)
4. Add more references in each chapter. (If anyone has a suggestion for good references please let me know!)
5. Additional editing and content addition throughout.
